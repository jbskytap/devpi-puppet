This is a Puppet module to install [devpi-server](http://doc.devpi.net/latest/) behind a NginX proxy.
See also [debianized-devpi](https://github.com/jhermann/devpi-enterprisey/tree/master/debianized-devpi)
for building the required `devpi` package.
On non-Debian platforms, you can use [fpm](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm) or similar tools to build such a package.


## Using the module
